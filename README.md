# BT5153 - GROUP 7 - FAKE REVIEWS DETECTION

In recent years, online consumer reviews have gained increasing importance and have become a fundamental aspect of the shopping experience and decision making for customers across e-commerce and traditional retail sectors. The rise in fake reviews driven by their profitability has led to a growing presence of deceptive feedback, posing risks to both consumers and businesses. Consequently, identifying these fake reviews is essential to protect consumers and honest businesses. In this project, we explore various deep learning models using an Amazon e-commerce dataset containing both GPT-2 generated fake reviews and genuine product reviews to develop a fake review detector. We train, validate, and refine the model using this dataset to improve its performance. Our experiments show that the deep learning model we propose effectively detects fake reviews, achieving impressive performance metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score, thereby demonstrating its state-of-the-art efficacy.
